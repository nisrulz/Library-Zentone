## Including in your project

ZenTone is available in the MavenCentral, so getting it as simple as adding it as a dependency
inside your build.gradle file

```gradle
implementation "com.github.nisrulz:zentone:$version"
```

where `$version` corresponds to latest version published in
MavenCentral: [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.nisrulz/zentone/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.github.nisrulz/zentone)

## Usage

Create an instance of ZenTone:

```kt
val zenTone = ZenTone()
```

To start playing audio with a frequency and volume:

```kt
zenTone.play(frequency = 400f, volume = 2)
```

here

- `400f` is frequency of type `Float`
- `2` is volume of type `Int`. It ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 is no audio and 100 is full volume.

To stop playing audio:

```kt
zenTone.stop()
```

To release resources held by ZenTone i.e release mic, you can call `release()` function. Usually you'll need to call this in `onDestroy()`:

```kt
override fun onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy()
    zenTone.release()
}
```

Check if ZenTone is playing audio by querying the `isPlaying` flag:

```kt
val isPlaying = zenTone.isPlaying
```
