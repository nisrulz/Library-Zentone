## Including in your project

ZenTone is available in the MavenCentral, so getting it as simple as adding it as a dependency
inside your build.gradle file

```gradle
implementation "com.github.nisrulz:zentone:$version"
```

where `$version` corresponds to latest version published in [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.nisrulz/zentone)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.github.nisrulz/zentone)
